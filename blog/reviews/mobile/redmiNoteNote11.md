# Affordable & Powerful Performer - Redmi Note 11

&emsp; I was exploring Amazon to find a perfect gift for a loved one who was not having a good phone. They were managing the 6-year-old android. There is nothing wrong with that unless the phone is in good condition. As it became troublesome and all, I planned to gift them a perfect smartphone, which should also be within my budget.

&emsp; After hours of surfing, **Redmi Note 11** quickly grabbed my attention with two key points: It comes with a **33W fast charger**(adapter) in the box, and the price point is considerably cheap for such specs.
