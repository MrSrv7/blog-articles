# Beware of Fake ChatGPTs

&emsp; **OpenAI's** **ChatGPT** chatbot has taken the world by storm in a few months, amassing over 100 million users. Unfortunately, this tremendous success has also attracted the attention of cybercriminals, who use the tool's popularity to spread malware for Windows and Android devices or lead unsuspecting users to phishing websites.

## Intro

&emsp; If you haven't known what **ChatGPT** is, **ChatGPT** is an AI language model developed by **OpenAI**, an artificial intelligence research laboratory consisting of the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP and its parent company, the non-profit OpenAI Inc. ChatGPT is capable of generating human-like text responses to a wide range of prompts, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing and generating creative content. Since its introduction in 2022, ChatGPT has quickly gained popularity, with more than 100 million users as of January 2023. It has been used for various purposes, including language translation, chatbot development, and creative writing. However, its popularity has also attracted threat actors who use fake ChatGPT apps to spread malware for Windows and Android or lead victims to phishing websites.

## ChatGPT Plus & the Security Threats

&emsp; By seeing the massive success and traffic, **OpenAI** introduced a pilot subscription plan in the U.S. and a few other countries for **ChatGPT,** and the price is set to be **20$ per month**.  Following are the benefits of the same.

- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times
- Faster response times
- Priority access to new features and improvements

&emsp; **ChatGPT** already got the attention and became a common target of the **Threat Actors.** **Android** devices are vulnerable to malware spread through fake **ChatGPT** apps. The **Google Play Store** is the official app store for Android devices, but it is not immune to malicious apps. In addition to fake ChatGPT apps, there are also malicious apps masquerading as legitimate ones. These can be used to steal personal information or spread malware to other devices. **Windows** devices are also vulnerable to malware spread through fake ChatGPT apps. This can be especially dangerous, as the malware can spread to other devices on the same network. It is important to be aware of the signs of a malicious app and take steps to protect your device.

> <em>Malware is malicious software that can be used to steal personal information or cause damage to your computer or device. Fake ChatGPT apps often contain malware, which can be spread to other users through the app. This malware can cause various problems, including identity theft, data loss, and system crashes.</em>

&emsp; Another common scam involves fake ChatGPT Plus subscriptions. Fake websites offer users a “free” subscription to ChatGPT Plus, a premium app version. However, these websites are phishing scams designed to steal personal information or spread malware. A **Facebook** page with a ChatGPT logo directs unsuspecting users to a malicious website, where they are prompted to download a bogus ChatGPT app. The app is designed to look like the real thing but is infected with malware that can steal personal data or damage the device.

> Phishing attacks are cyber attacks that use social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing personal information.

## Stay Safe

&emsp; ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can greatly assist our work. Yet, every good product has cheap copies. The best way to protect yourself from these attacks is to be vigilant and careful when downloading new software. Until now, the only way to access ChatGPT is via their official website, https://chat.openai.com. There are no native platform apps for Android, iOS, or Windows (so far). Always check the legitimacy of an app or website before downloading it. Look for reviews, ratings, and other signs of authenticity. Additionally, keep your software up to date, as new security patches are often released to protect against known vulnerabilities. Always use antivirus software and keep it updated to protect your device from malware.

## Conclusion

&emsp; As new technologies emerge, so do new risks. Hackers are always looking for new ways to exploit popular platforms and applications. Always check the legitimacy of an app or website before downloading or even using it. We can protect ourselves and our devices from these threats by staying informed and vigilant. So, beware of suspicious apps and websites, keep your software up to date, and use antivirus software to keep your device safe.
