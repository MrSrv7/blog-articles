&emsp; In today's digital world, having a website or a web application is crucial for any business or individual looking to establish their online presence. However, developing a website or web application can be prone to mistakes that cost time, money, and reputation. So when working on a web application or a static site, beware of the ten common mistakes.

## TL; DR (Concepts covered in this post)

- Browser Compatibility
- Performance Optimization
- Ignoring Accessibility Standards
- Security Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient Scalability

## Intro

&emsp; In today’s digital age, having a strong online presence is crucial for the success of any business. To ensure that your website is efficient, secure, and user-friendly, it’s essential to be aware of common web development mistakes that can lead to poor user experience, loss of potential customers, and even legal issues. Let’s discuss what they are and how to avoid them.

## Browser Incompatibility

&emsp; Neglecting browser compatibility in web development is a common mistake that can lead to a poor user experience for certain users. This mistake occurs when developers fail to ensure their website or application is compatible with all major web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. This can be due to differences in how browsers interpret web code or handle certain features. Failing to test and ensure compatibility across multiple browsers can result in lost business opportunities.

&emsp; One famous example of neglecting browser compatibility is the ***healthcare.gov*** website launched in 2013. When the website was first launched, it only worked on a few web browsers, including the latest version of Chrome and Firefox. Users who tried to access the website using Internet Explorer or older versions of Chrome and Firefox encountered a range of issues, including broken links, error messages, and pages that wouldn't load properly.

### Common best practices to avoid Browser Compatibility Issues

- Use Feature Detection Instead of Browser Detection
- Use Modern Web Standards (like HTML5) and Best Practices
- Test on Multiple Browsers and Devices
- Use a CSS Reset or Normalize.css to prefix CSS Properties Appropriately.
- Use authentic, reputed JavaScript Libraries and Polyfills for Cross-Browser Support.

## Poor Optimization

&emsp; Slow-loading websites can be frustrating for users and can hurt your business. Even a one-second delay in website load time can result in a 7% decrease in conversions. Slow load times can also affect your website's search engine ranking, as Google has indicated that website speed is a factor in its ranking algorithm.

&emsp; As you see in the below example, [PetSmart](https://petsmart.com) is an e-commerce platform for buying pet-related products. Still, the initial page load time is around 4 seconds, and most people might close the site or switch to alternatives which is a huge negative impact on their business.

### Common Best Practices to avoid Poor Optimization

- Optimize Images and Files
- Improve Code Quality
- Minimize HTTP Requests
- Reduce Server Response Time
- Enable Compression and Browser Caching
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Use Asynchronous Loading

## Ignoring Accessibility Standards

&emsp; The goal of accessibility is to create products and services that are usable by as many people as possible. Accessibility is especially important for people with disabilities who may use assistive technologies such as screen readers, voice recognition software, and other tools to access digital content. According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health), over 1 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability, making it essential for businesses and organizations to prioritize accessibility in their digital offerings.

&emsp; There was a [Lawsuit against Beyoncé's website by Mary Conner in 2019](https://www.scribd.com/document/396757637/Conner-v-Parkwood) by a visually impaired woman. The website allegedly violated the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** by not providing alternative text for images, making it difficult for visually impaired individuals to understand the content. This lawsuit highlights the importance of making websites accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Common Best Practices to implement Web Accessibility Standards

- Conduct an **Accessibility Audit** and create **Accessibility Policies** accordingly.
- Add Alternative Text for Images
- Use **ARIA** Landmarks
- Design with appropriate Color Contrast
- Ensure Keyboard, Video, and Audio Accessibility
- Stay Up-to-Date with Accessibility Standards

## Security Vulnerabilities

&emsp; Security vulnerabilities are a major concern for businesses and individuals in the digital age. With increasing cyberattacks and data breaches, it is important to understand the types of security vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

&emsp; In 2017, credit reporting agency **Equifax** suffered a [massive data breach](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Equifax-Report.pdf), affecting over **143 million** customers. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in the company's web application software, which allowed hackers to access sensitive information such as names, birthdates, social security numbers, and addresses.

### Common ways to avoid Security Vulnerabilities

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption
- Regular Security Assessments, Patches, and Updates
- Limiting dependencies

## Insufficient Scalability

&emsp; As businesses grow and evolve, their technology infrastructure needs to scale and adapt to meet changing needs. In today's rapidly changing digital landscape, businesses must be agile and adaptable to survive. One key aspect is the ability to scale systems and infrastructure to meet changing demands.

&emsp; In 2018, **Amazon's** annual *Prime Day sale* suffered from inefficient scalability. The site was overwhelmed with traffic, causing the site to crash and preventing customers from accessing deals. This resulted in lost sales and negative publicity for the company. This occurs when technology systems are not designed with enough flexibility to accommodate changing business requirements. Inefficient adaptability can lead to excessive downtime, higher maintenance costs, and lost revenue due to missed opportunities.

### Common ways to avoid Scalability Issues

- Load Balancing
- Caching
- Horizontal & Vertical Scaling
- Distributed & Cloud Computing
- Regular Performance Monitoring, Testing, and Optimization

## Conclusion

&emsp; In conclusion, avoiding common web development mistakes is crucial to ensure that websites and web applications perform efficiently, effectively, and securely. Developers need to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development to avoid falling behind and making mistakes that can be costly in terms of time, money, and reputation. Web developers can create websites and applications that meet and exceed user expectations by focusing on quality and efficiency.
