# Understanding the Browserslist Warning

&emsp; If you have ever worked with a **ReactJS** application or any frontend application like **Angular** or **VueJS** etc., you might have encountered the following warning message in your console:

&emsp; While this message might seem confusing initially, it's a useful warning that you shouldn't ignore. Let’s have a deeper look.

## Intro

&emsp;Let’s say you're working on a website for a small business owner who wants their website accessible to as many potential customers as possible. You want to ensure the website looks great and functions smoothly on all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Using **Browserslist**, you can specify these browsers and ensure that your code is optimized. **Browserslist** will automatically generate the necessary configuration to support those browsers, including any prefixes or workarounds required to ensure compatibility. This will save you hours of debugging and make your client happy by delivering a polished product.

## What is Browserslist?

&emsp;**[Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/)** is a tool to share browser lists between different front-end tools. It allows developers to specify which browsers they want to support in their projects and then shares this information with tools like **[Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)**, **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)**, and others.

&emsp;**Browserslist** uses data from [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com) to determine which browsers are in use and their corresponding versions. The tool has a configuration file that contains a list of browsers and their versions. This configuration file is used to specify which browsers to support.

## The Warning

&emsp; Now that we know about **Browserslist**, why does the above warning even come when you work in a **[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)** app or mostly any frontend **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)** app? **Browserslist** is an **[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserslist)** and could be one of the dependencies for any of the packages you are using, as it helps other tools like **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)**, where we can specify that our project should support all modern browsers, including the last two versions of **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari**, **PostCSS** will automatically add the necessary vendor prefixes for features that require them and provide fallbacks for features that aren't yet widely supported. This can save you a lot of time and effort in ensuring that your **CSS** works consistently across all target browsers.

&emsp;If we ignore the **Browserslist** warning, it can cause problems in our project. For instance, if we're using **Autoprefixer** and the caniuse-lite database is outdated, it might add prefixes to your **CSS** that aren't needed or might not add prefixes that are needed. This can lead to compatibility issues in different browsers and might cause your website to look different or not work as expected.

## The Fixation

&emsp;To fix the **Browserslist** warning, you need to update the `caniuse-lite` database that Browserslist uses. To do this, you can run the following command in your project directory:

```javasc
npx browserslist@latest --update-db
```

&emsp;This command will download the latest version of the `caniuse-lite` database and update your Browserslist configuration file. After running this command, you should no longer see the Browserslist warning in your console.

## Conclusion

&emsp; The **Browserslist** warning is important that you shouldn't ignore. Updating the `caniuse-lite` database that **Browserslist** uses is a simple fix that can prevent potential problems in your project. By understanding the warning and taking the necessary steps to fix it, you can ensure that your ExpressJS app runs smoothly and is compatible with all major browsers.
